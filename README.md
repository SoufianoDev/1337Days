Welcome to **1337Days**, my personal **training** repository of solutions and notes for the C Piscine at the [1337/42 Network](https://1337.ma/) coding school.

> ⚠️ This is **not an official Piscine repo**. It's strictly for training and learning purposes.

The *Piscine* ("swimming pool" in French) is an intense **4-week bootcamp** where candidates code daily, peer-evaluate each other, and learn by doing. This repo documents my **training and preparation**, providing ready-to-compile C source code and notes.

## 🌊 Piscine Training Tips

1. **Help your peers** – you learn by explaining.
2. **Google & man pages are key** – search before asking.
3. **Write edge-case tests** – catch bugs early.
4. **Norminette matters** – run it often.
5. **Fail fast, iterate** – it's part of the journey.
